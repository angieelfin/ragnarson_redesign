        p class="timeline-paragraph"
          | Tripsta generates around 30GB of search data throughout the day. This data is used to present users with flights of their choice and otherwise remains unused. However it is a source of valuable business intelligence - it just needs to be properly summarized.

        p class="timeline-paragraph"
          | We have built a separate service based on Goliath that handles data collection and statistics. We have based our solution on map/reduce pattern. Results are collected as fast as possible and dumped to filesystem. Their processing is queued up using Resque/Redis. Response time is a steady 1ms, way below our limit.

        p class="timeline-paragraph"
          | Each result needs to be processed and intelligence data needs to be extracted from it. It takes 300ms for each Resque worker to extract necessary information. As this is done in background it doesn't impact overall application performance and when necessary can be scaled to multiple computing nodes without a problem.
